## Project 2: Cancer Detection

### Description

The objective of this project was to build an AI model that could predict if a cell is cancerous or not, based on a set of features.

The dataset used was the [Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erdemtaha/cancer-data) from Kaggle.

All the project work was done in a Jupyter Notebook, which can be found in the `Project2` folder.

### How to run

To run the notebook, simply move to the `Project2` folder and run the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then select the `project.ipynb` file to see it.

### Presentation

The presentation is inside the doc folder, just like in the previous project.
