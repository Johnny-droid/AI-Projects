1. When finding the outliers in the data set, even though they follow the trend,
should we filter out the outlier?


2. How do we decide if we should oversample or undersample the data set?
Or should we try both?


3. What it's the identification of the target concept exactly?

4. Should I divide the training and testing set, or should I use just use cross validation?
I was thinking about first doing the grid in order to find the best option, and the grid uses cross validation.
